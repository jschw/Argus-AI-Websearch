For one, they can increase your dietary fiber intake, which is essential considering most Americans get only half the amount they should, (per University of California San Francisco). However, simply mixing fruits and liquids is one of the biggest mistakes people make with smoothies. Instead, you should try to mix & match different food groups — fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and proteins. For fiber, use whole grains such as oats or bran. Fruits, vegetables, and berries will also add fiber, as well as vitamins and antioxidants. Healthy fats can be obtained from avocados, nut butter, flax, chia, and hemp seeds.
